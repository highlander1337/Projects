| Just A      Web      Scraper Proficient Igenious Artificial Mechanism | Is an artificial intelligence based "web scraping" system, whose main purpose is to enhance research & development capabilities of Embedded Firmware and Hardware Technicians. The main goal is to provide enlightenment about the technologies that could be useful to understand specific problem domains supplied by the clients and propose solution domains statistically mostly capable of overcome the challenges of the problem domain in a timely manner. | Within 45~48 hours (estimated_time  from JAWSPIAM with 95% of likelihood using the given premises and problem domain definition) we will get to know if ATECC608A is the mostly used microchip to solve the CryptoAuthentication problem integrated to the ESP32-S3 and a STM32 microcontrollers. List as well, other similar hardware technologies that could be useful to solve the problem domain ( to secure boot load and firmware upgrades). | Beyond my actual capabilities. | Those videos are good start points: [(3292) Python Automation Tutorial – How to Automate Tasks for Beginners Full Course\] - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8XjEuplx_U&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)<br />[(3292) Automate with Python – Full Course for Beginners - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXMJ6FS7llk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)<br />[Data Analysis with Python - Full Course for Beginners (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8&t=277s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) |
